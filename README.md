# todo-server

server for the [todo-client](https://github.com/MetaTech-dev/todo-client)

## Getting Started

- make sure you have node installed, recommend using nvm
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- use todo-server postman collection to test endpoints (ask an admin for an invite to the postman workspace)

## Notes

- currently, if there's no orgId we are using userId
- as Clerk rolls out updates, this API will likely get updated and optimised to take advantage of those features
